"""
Migration safety validator.

Called at service startup AFTER alembic runs. Confirms:
  1. The alembic version table exists (migrations were run).
  2. A revision row exists (upgrade() was not a no-op pass).
  3. Every required table is present (upgrade() actually created them).

Raises RuntimeError on any failure — aborts the lifespan and prevents
the service from accepting traffic with a broken schema.
